You are given the head of a singly linked list and an integer key.

Return true if the key exists in the linked list, otherwise return false.

Example 1

Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4], key = 3

Output: true

Explanation: The linked list is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. The key 3 is present in the list.

Example 2

Input: head = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], key = 5

Output: false

Explanation: The key 5 is not present in the list.

Constraints

    The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range 1 <= n <= 10⁵.
    The value of each node is in the range 1 <= Node.val <= 10⁵.
    1 <= key <= 10⁵
