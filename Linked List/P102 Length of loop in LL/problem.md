Given the head of a singly linked list, find the length of the loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the length of the loop if it exists; otherwise, return 0.


A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.


Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Example 1

Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1

Output: 4

Explanation: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 - >2, length of loop = 4.

Example 2

Input: head -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4, pos = -1

Output: 0

Explanation: No loop is present in the linked list.

Constraints

    0 <= number of nodes in the cycle <= 105
    0 <= ListNode.val <= 104
    pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked list
