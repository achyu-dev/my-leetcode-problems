Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer X, insert a node with value X at the head of the linked list and return the head of the modified list.

Example 1

Input: linkedList = [1, 2, 3], X = 7

Output: [7, 1, 2, 3]

Explanation:

7 was added as the 1st node.

Example 2

Input: linkedList = [], X = 7

Output: [7]

Explanation:

7 was added as the 1st node.

Constraints

    0 <= number of nodes in the Linked List <= 1000
    0 <= ListNode.val <= 100
    0 <= X <= 100
