Given two numbers N and M, find the Nth root of M. The Nth root of a number M is defined as a number X such that when X is raised to the power of N, it equals M. If the Nth root is not an integer, return -1.
Examples:

Input: N = 3, M = 27

Output: 3

Explanation: The cube root of 27 is equal to 3.

Input: N = 4, M = 69

Output:-1

Explanation: The 4th root of 69 does not exist. So, the answer is -1.
