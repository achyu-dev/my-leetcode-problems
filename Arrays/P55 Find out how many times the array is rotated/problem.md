Given an integer array nums of size n, sorted in ascending order with distinct values. The array has been right rotated an unknown number of times, between 0 and n-1 (including). Determine the number of rotations performed on the array.
Examples:

Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]

Output: 4

Explanation: The original array should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 4 times.

Input: nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Output: 3

Explanation: The original array should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 3 times.

Constraints:

     n == nums.length
     1 <= n <= 104
     -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
     All the integers of nums are unique.
