You are given an integer array queries of length n.

Return the prime factorization of each number in array queries in sorted order.

Example 1

Input : queries = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output : [ [2], [3], [2, 2], [5], [2, 3] ]

Explanation : The values 2, 3, 5 are itself prime numbers.

The prime factorization of 4 will be --> 2 * 2.

The prime factorization of 6 will be --> 2 * 3.

Example 2

Input : queries = [7, 12, 18]

Output : [ [7], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3] ]

Explanation : The value 7 itself is a prime number.

The prime factorization of 12 will be --> 2 * 2 * 3.

The prime factorization of 18 will be --> 2 * 3 * 3.
