Given two integers n and i, return true if the ith bit in the binary representation of n (counting from the least significant bit, 0-indexed) is set (i.e., equal to 1). Otherwise, return false.

Example 1

Input: n = 5, i = 0

Output: true

Explanation: Binary representation of 5 is 101. The 0-th bit from LSB is set (1).


Example 2

Input: n = 10, i = 1

Output: true

Explanation: Binary representation of 10 is 1010. The 1-st bit from LSB is set (1).

Constraints

    1 <= n <= 109
    0 <= i <= 31
