Given an integer n, return the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation.


Can you solve it in O(log n) time complexity?

Example 1

Input: n = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101, which has 2 set bits.

Example 2

Input: n = 15

Output: 4

Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is 1111, which has 4 set bits.

Constraints

    1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹
