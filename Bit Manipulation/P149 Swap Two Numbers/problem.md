Given two integers a and b, swap them in-place using only 2 variables (without using a temporary variable).


Can you solve it using:

    Arithmetic operations?
    Bitwise XOR?

Example 1

Input: a = 5, b = 10

Output: a = 10, b = 5

Example 2

Input: a = -100, b = -200

Output: a = -200, b = -100

Constraints

    109 <= a, b <= 109
