Given a non-negative integer n, determine whether it is odd.

Return true if the number is odd, otherwise return false.


A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 != 0).

Example 1

Input: n = 7

Output: true

Explanation: 7 is not divisible by 2. Hence, it is odd.

Example 2

Input: n = 0

Output: false

Explanation: 0 is divisible by 2. Hence, it is not odd.

Constraints

    0 <= n <= 104
