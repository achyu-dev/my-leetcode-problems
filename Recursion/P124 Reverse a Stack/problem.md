You are given a stack of integers. Your task is to reverse the stack using recursion. You may only use standard stack operations (push, pop, top/peek, isEmpty). You are not allowed to use any loop constructs or additional data structures like arrays or queues.


Your solution must modify the input stack in-place to reverse the order of its elements.

Example 1

Input: stack = [4, 1, 3, 2]

Output: [2, 3, 1, 4]

Example 2

Input: stack = [10, 20, -5, 7, 15]

Output: [15, 7, -5, 20, 10]

Constraints

    1 <= N <= 100 (where N is the number of elements in the stack)
    Must use only recursion (no loops or built-in reverse methods)
    Auxiliary space allowed: O(N) (due to recursion stack)
